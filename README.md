# AirbnbNLP
Analyzed data from: https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data


Performed analysis using Python with the packages: matplotlib, plotly, pandas, numpy and seaborn.


Using the popular Natural Language Processing library, spacy, I was able to clean the listing names and extract relevant information such as the most frequently used words as well as any non-english symbols used in the dataset.
